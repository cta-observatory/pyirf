Welcome to pyirf's documentation!
================================

pyirf can:

  * find the best cutoff in gammaness/score, to discriminate between signal
    and background, as well as the angular cut to obtain the best sensitivity
    for a given amount of observation time and a given template for the
    source of interest (:ref:`pyirf`)
  * compute the instrument response functions, effective area,
    point spread function and energy resolution (:ref:`pyirf`)
  * estimate the sensitivity (:ref:`pyirf`)

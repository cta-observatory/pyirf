Description
+++++++++++

This release is mainly a maintenance release with few changes to the functionality.
The main feature is the update to gammapy 0.19 in the tests and the utility functions
to get gammapy IRF classes from pyirf output.

In the future, we will more directly interface with and use gammapy, now that
the science tool decision was taken.

Description
+++++++++++

Main new feature in this release are functions to interpolate grids of IRFs
to, e.g. for different pointing directions, to new IRFs.
Supported at the moment are effective area and energy dispersion.

We also added a function to compute energy bias and resolution from the
energy dispersion IRF and a new spectrum for cosmic rays: the DAMPE combined
proton and helium spectrum.

The other pull requests are mainly maintenance and a small bugfix.

Description
+++++++++++

This release is an important update that introduces three
changes in the cut optimization, background estimation and sensitivity calculation.

Together, these changes bring the calculated sensitivities much closer to the ones calculated by
EventDisplay.

* Scale the relative flux calculated to reach the target sensitivity
  up if the requirements on the minimum number of signal events are not met.
  Essentially, instead of always calculating the flux that
  yields ``target_sensitivity`` and then checking if the two other conditions are met,
  we increase the required flux to meet the other requirements.
  This can result in new sensitivities where before pyirf would report no sensitivities,
  and report better sensitivities everywhere where the event number conditions where not
  met before at the target significance.
  The best sensitivity now is the lowest flux that just barely satisfies all
  requirements (so is at the minimum requirement of one of the three).

* Differentiate between `reco_source_fov_offset` and `true_source_fov_offset`,
  using the former for background rates and the latter for everything concerning
  signal events.

* Change ``optimize_gh_cut`` to do the optimization in terms of efficiency and
  limit this efficiency to max. 80 % in the EventDisplay comparison.


Smaller improvements also include:

* It is now possible to include a ``particle_type`` column in the event lists,
  which will result in additionally reporting all event counts also per ``particle_type``.
  E.g. if ``particle_type`` is included in the background table consisting of both
  electrons and protons, ``estimate_background`` will not only report ``n_background(_weighted)``
  but also ``n_electron(_weighted)`` and ``n_proton(_weighted)``

* ``relative_sensitivity`` now supports vectorized application and broadcasting
  of inputs, as previously wrongly advertized in the docstring.

GammaPy ``0.18.0`` was released and includes fixes for IRF axis orders.
The output of ``pyirf`` in GADF fits format can now be read by gammapy without
problems.
The workarounds for installing GammaPy is also no longer needed.

Description
+++++++++++

This release is the result of the IRF sprint week in September 2020.
Many bug fixes and improvements were made to the code.

As the target for the sprint week was to reproduce the approach of ``EventDisplay`` and
the resulting IRFs, one scheme of cut optimization is implemented.
The ``examples/calculate_eventdisplay_irfs.py`` should follow the approach
of ``EventDisplay`` closely and shows what is currently implemented in ``pyirf``.
In the central and upper energy range, ``pyirf`` now reproduces the ``EventDisplay`` sensitivity
exactly, the lower energy bins still show some disagreement.
The cut optimization seems not yet to be the same as EventDisplay's and will be further investigated.
This example could be used as a starting point if you also want to do cut optimization for best sensitivity.


At least one version of each IRF is now implemented and can be stored in the GADF format.
Computation of full-enclosure IRFs should be possible but is of now not yet tested
on a reference dataset.

Description
+++++++++++

For this version, pyirf's API was completely rewritten from scratch,
merging code from several projects (pyirf, pyfact, fact-project/irf) to provide a library to compute IACT
IRFs and sensitivity and store them in the GADF data format.

The class based API using a configuration file was replaced by a finer grained
function based API.

Implemented are point-like IRFs and sensitivity.

This release was the starting point for the IRF sprint week in September 2020,
where the refactoring continued.

In prior versions of pyirf, the energy dispersion matrix was normalized to a
sum of 1 over the migration axis.
This is wrong, the correct normalization is to an integral of 1, which is fixed now.

The internal API of the interpolation functions had to be adapted to take in additional
keywords, mainly the bin edges and the kind of normalization (standard or solid angle cone sections).

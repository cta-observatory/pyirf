Change the interpolation API to top-level estimator classes that instantiate 
interp- and extrapolator objects. Drops the ``interpolate_xyz`` functions 
originally used to interpolate a xyz IRF component in favour of a ``XYZEstimator``
class. Moves data checks from intepolator to estimator classes. 

Direct usage of interpolator objects is now discuraged, use estimator objects instead.

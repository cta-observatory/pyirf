Add a fixture containing three IRFs from `the prod5 IRF data-release <https://zenodo.org/record/5499840>`
for unit testing. Specifically the fixture contains the contents of:
* Prod5-North-20deg-AverageAz-4LSTs.180000s-v0.1.fits.gz.
* Prod5-North-40deg-AverageAz-4LSTs.180000s-v0.1.fits.gz
* Prod5-North-60deg-AverageAz-4LSTs.180000s-v0.1.fits.gz

The user has to download these irfs to ``pyirf/resources/irfs/`` using ``download_irfs.py``,
github's CI does so automatically and caches them for convenience.

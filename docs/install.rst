Installation
============

``pyirf`` requires Python â‰¥3.7 and pip, plus the packages defined in
the ``setup.py``.

Core dependencies are

* ``numpy``
* ``astropy``
* ``scipy``

We provide an environment file for Anaconda or Miniconda users.

Installing a released version
-----------------------------

To install a released version, just install the ``pyirf`` package using

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyirf

or add it to the dependencies of your project.

Installing for development
--------------------------

If you want to work on pyirf itself, clone the repository and install the local
copy of pyirf in development mode.

The dependencies required to perform unit-testing and to build the documentation
are defined in ``extras`` under ``tests`` and ``docs`` respectively.

These requirements can also be enabled by installing the ``all`` extra:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e '.[all]'  # or [docs,tests] to install them separately


You should isolate your pyirf development environment from the rest of your system.
Either by using a virtual environment or by using ``conda`` environments.
``pyirf`` provides a conda ``environment.yml``, that includes all dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda env create -f environment.yml
   $ conda activate pyirf
   $ pip install -e '.[all]'

In order to have passing unit-tests you have to download some CTA IRFs 
from `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/5499840>`. Simply run 

.. code-block:: bash 

   $ python download_irfs.py 

which will download and unpack three IRF files to ``irfs/``.

Run the tests to make sure everything is OK: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest
